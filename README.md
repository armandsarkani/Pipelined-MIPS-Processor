# **Pipelined-MIPS-Processor**
A 32-bit MIPS pipelined processor designed in Verilog for the UCI EECS 112L class. 

## Overview
This processor was designed as part of the Lab 4 assignment during the Winter 2020 quarter for EECS 112L at UCI. It models a 32-bit MIPS processor with a 5-stage pipelined datapath (IF, ID, EX, MEM, WB). This processor also supports the detection of data and control hazards, as well as forwarding in cases of data dependencies on previous instructions.
